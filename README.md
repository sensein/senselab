Welcome to ```senselab```! This is a Python package for streamlining the processing and analysis of behavioral data, such as voice and speech patterns, with robust and reproducible methodologies.

**Caution:**: this package is still under development and may change rapidly over the next few weeks.

## Installation
Install this package via:

```sh
pip install senselab
```

Or get the newest development version via:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/sensein/senselab.git
```

## Quick start
```Python
from senselab.audio.data_structures import Audio
from senselab.audio.tasks.preprocessing import resample_audios

audio1 = Audio.from_filepath('path_to_audio_file.wav')

print("The original audio has a sampling rate of {} Hz.".format(audio1.sampling_rate))
[audio1] = resample_audios([audio1], resample_rate=16000)
print("The resampled audio has a sampling rate of {} Hz.".format(audio1.sampling_rate))
```

For more detailed information, check out our [**Getting Started Tutorial**](https://github.com/sensein/senselab/blob/main/tutorials/audio/getting_started.ipynb).
