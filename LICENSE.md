For clarity:

* The **core** of this project is licensed under **Apache-2.0**.
* **Optional** functionality depending on:
  - **`notebook-intelligence`** (GPL-3.0) and **`praat-parselmouth`** (GPL-3.0)
    → Using or distributing the project together with these components subjects the combined distribution to GPL-3.0 obligations.
  - **`ultralytics`** (AGPL-3.0)
    → Using or distributing the project together with this component subjects the combined distribution to AGPL-3.0 obligations.
  - **`pycountry`** (LGPL-2.1)
    → The project may depend dynamically on this component while remaining Apache-2.0; however, modifications or static incorporation are subject to LGPL-2.1 obligations.
  - **`coqui-tts`** (MPL-2.0)
    → Modifications to MPL-licensed files must be released under MPL-2.0, though the rest of the project remains Apache-2.0.
  - **`opensmile`** (audEERING Research License)
    → Licensed for non-commercial use only (academic research, teaching, evaluation).
      Any use in products or other commercial applications requires a separate commercial license from audEERING GmbH.
* If you do **not** install or distribute the GPL, AGPL, LGPL, MPL, or custom-licensed optional components, your use of this project remains under the **Apache-2.0 License** only.

**Note:** If you are uncertain about your rights or obligations under these licenses, you should seek advice from a qualified legal professional.
