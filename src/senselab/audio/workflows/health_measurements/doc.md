# Measuring Health Using Speech and Voice Metrics

## Overview

Health measurement through speech and voice analysis is an emerging interdisciplinary field with significant potential in clinical and remote health monitoring. By leveraging advances in machine learning, deep learning, and signal processing, speech and voice data can reveal a range of health indicators, particularly useful for assessing mental and neurological health conditions. These metrics capture both vocal and linguistic features that can reflect emotional, cognitive, and physical states, providing insights that are less invasive than traditional methods.

In section, you can find some workflows and pipelines aiming to extract and refine useful measurements and explore their potential for quick, non-intrusive health assessments and monitoring. Integrating these speech-derived measures with broader health monitoring systems could contribute significantly to early diagnosis, personalized treatment, and ongoing health monitoring across various clinical applications.
