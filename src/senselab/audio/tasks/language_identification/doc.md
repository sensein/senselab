## Task Overview
Language identification is the process of determining the natural language being spoken in an audio sample.

## Models

In `senselab`, we integrate [speechbrain](https://speechbrain.github.io/) models for language identification. These models can be explored on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain?search_models=lang-id). They both work under the assumption that maximum one natural language is spoken in an audio sample. We may integrate additional approaches for language identification into the package in the future.
