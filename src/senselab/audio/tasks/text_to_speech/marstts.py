        Some tips for best quality:
            - Make sure reference audio is clean and between 1 second and 12 seconds.
            - Use deep clone and provide an accurate transcript for the reference.
              Mars5-TTS can potentially accept audio target voices without transcripts. After some testing,
              we found that the best quality is achieved with deep cloning and providing an accurate transcript.
            - Use proper punctuation -- the model can be guided and made better or worse with proper use of punctuation
                and capitalization.
