"""This module contains functions for extracting openSMILE features.

It includes a factory class for managing openSMILE feature extractors, ensuring
each extractor is created only once per feature set and feature level. The main
function, `extract_opensmile_features_from_audios`, applies feature extraction
across a list of audio samples using openSMILE, managed as a Pydra workflow
for parallel processing. This approach supports efficient and scalable feature
extraction across multiple audio files.
